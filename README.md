# Vrinda-Store-Annual-Report
Hello, Everyone I am sharing my data analysis project with the help of MS Excel. I have picked the dataset from the Rishabh Mishra youtube channel.

**Objective:

Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022 so that the store can understand its marketing strategy and grow more sales in 2023.

**Questions asked:

Compare the sales and orders using a single chart and also find the month that has got the highest sales and orders.

Who purchased more in 2022, men or women?

What are the different order status in 2022?

What are the top 5 states that contributed to maximum sales?

Show the relation between Age and gender based on the number of orders.

Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

**Analysis:

First of all, I understood the data in the data sets and find the business problems.

I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from the Age column using the IF function.

Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems.

At Last, I have built a dashboard in Excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results.

**Key insights:

The highest sales and orders were recorded in the month of March.

Women purchased more than Men

Maximum order status was seen to be delivered

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu are the top 5 highest sales states.

Women of the Adult age group were the highest to place orders

Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart channels are contributing to maximum sales

**Final conclusion for improving the sales :

The store must target more Women customers of the Adult age group living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu by giving more discounts, offers and coupons, and gifts above a particular purchase amount available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.
